# Verlet-Integration-Library

Hello, thanks for viewing my project! 

I was inspired by another Reddit post (which I cannot locate now) of a hanging mesh being cut

I created a very basic library to track and calculate the movements of 2-d objects in a pygame environment. This project uses verlet integration to calculate the X & Y positions of "balls" on the screen based on the objects last recorded position. Rods are are attached between 
balls to constrain the motion of joined pairs. Many rods can be used in conjunction with eachother to form shapes and objects with physical properties like rigid structures. 

I wrote the code in a way that I thought could be readable for beginner programmers who find these types of projects fascinating and just want to play and disect it.
